Maximum Pairwise Product Problem
================================
Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers.
Input: A sequence of non-negative integers.
Output: The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence.
Input format: The first line contains an integer 𝑛. The next line contains n non-negative integers a1, ..., an (separated by spaces).
Output format: The maximum pairwise product.
Constraints: 2 < 𝑛 < 2 *10^5; 0 < a1, ..., an < 2*10^5.



Fibonacci Number
================
Given an integer 𝑛, find the 𝑛th Fibonacci number 𝐹𝑛.
Input Format: The input consists of a single integer 𝑛.
Constraints: 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 45.
Output Format: Output 𝐹𝑛.



Last Digit of a Large Fibonacci Number
======================================
Given an integer 𝑛, find the last digit of the 𝑛th Fibonacci number 𝐹𝑛 (that is, 𝐹𝑛 mod 10).
Input Format: The input consists of a single integer 𝑛.
Constraints: 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 107.
Output Format: Output the last digit of 𝐹𝑛.



Greatest Common Divisor
=======================
Given two integers 𝑎 and 𝑏, find their greatest common divisor.
Input Format: The two integers 𝑎, 𝑏 are given in the same line separated by space.
Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑎, 𝑏 ≤ 2 · 109.
Output Format: Output GCD(𝑎, 𝑏).
